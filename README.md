## Challenge Summary
The audit performed was simple to total the number of votes and categorize them by candidate or county. It can be used for any other type of election moving forward.
This script can also be modified to dive deeper into this particular election (or any others for that matter). An extra dictionary could be created to track each candidates totals/percentages in each county. This would give candidates during the next election more insight as to where their campaign efforts should be focused.
